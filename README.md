# Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) - Backend & Simulation

This repository contains the core backend logic, database management, and simulation testbench for the Smart Home Energy Management System. The project focuses on optimizing energy consumption through intelligent sensor-based control and occupancy-based automation.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns
The system is built using a **Layered Architectural Approach** to ensure modularity and scalability.

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented to allow `RoomSensors` (Subject) to notify both the `RoomController` and `DataLogger` (Observers).
- **Transition-Only Logging**: To ensure data integrity and precise duration-based energy math, appliance states are recorded only when a change (ON/OFF) occurs.
- **RESTful API**: A Flask-based API serves as the coordination layer for real-time monitoring and simulation control.

## 📊 Energy Computation Model
Energy consumption ($kWh$) is derived using duration-based integration:
- **AC Rating**: 1.5 kW
- **Lighting Rating**: 0.06 kW
- **Formula**: $kWh = \text{Power (kW)} \times \text{Duration (Hours)}$

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask requests

```

### 2. Start the API Server

Run the main application from the source directory to initialize the database and start the listener:

```bash
python src/app.py

```

### 3. Execute the 24-Hour Simulation

In a second terminal window, run the simulation script to process a full cycle:

```bash
python src/run_24h_sim.py

```

## 📉 Verified Results (Chapter 3)

Based on the verified 24-hour simulation results:

* **Baseline Consumption**: 36.72 kWh
* **Smart System Consumption**: 3.13 kWh
* **Total Energy Saved**: 33.59 kWh
* **Efficiency Increase**: **91.5%**
